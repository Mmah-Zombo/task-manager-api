2.  Revenue Sharing
    ---------------
    If you use the Software, in whole or in part, to develop or enhance any
    software, service, application, or product (a “Derivative Product”) that
    generates revenue (including, without limitation, sales, subscriptions,
    licensing fees, advertising revenue, or any other monetization), you
    agree to pay the original author (M’mah Zombo) seven percent (7%) of the
    gross profits derived from such Derivative Product, on a quarterly basis,
    within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar quarter. “Gross
    profits” means all revenue actually received, less returns, refunds,
    and sales taxes.

3.  Reporting and Audit
    -------------------
    Within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar quarter, you shall
    provide a written report to the original author showing gross revenues
    and the calculation of the 7% share. Upon reasonable notice and during
    normal business hours, you shall permit the original author (or an
    appointed auditor) to inspect records relating to the revenue derived
    from the Derivative Product, at your expense, to verify the accuracy of
    such reports.
